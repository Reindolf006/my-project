    <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>
        Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic 
        systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It combines technologies, processes, 
        and practices to protect digital information from theft, damage, or unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Cybersecurity is Important</h2>
    <p>
        Students store personal information, academic records, and financial data online. Without 
        proper cybersecurity awareness, they are at risk of identity theft, fraud, and exposure 
        to harmful content. Learning cybersecurity early builds a strong foundation for safe online 
        practices.
        Students also frequently use the internet for research, social media, online learning,
        and financial transactions. Without proper cybersecurity knowledge, they are exposed
        to cyber threats such as hacking, identity theft, and fraud.
