    <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        Cybersecurity threats are actions or events that could harm computer systems, networks, or data.
         Here are some examples:

    </ul>

    <h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Fraudulent messages designed to trick individuals into 
            revealing personal information, such as passwords and banking details.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software including viruses, trojans, and ransomware 
            that can damage computers or steal sensitive data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Password Attacks:</strong> Attempts to guess, steal, or brute-force passwords to 
            access private accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Manipulating users into performing actions or 
            disclosing confidential information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Unauthorized access to sensitive databases, often 
            exposing personal or academic information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    These threats can result in data loss, financial loss, and damage to personal reputation.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
    <p>
        Many students have lost access to email accounts or social media profiles due to weak 
        passwords or phishing attacks. Schools and universities have also experienced breaches 
        that exposed student data, highlighting the need for strong cybersecurity practices.
